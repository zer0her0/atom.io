### Bugs found in Atom.io as I work

- when opening a folder that is/was full screen it leave blank row that's as tall as the menubar (untoggling/retoggling fullscreen fixes this)
- toggle tabs by keyboard? (not sure what i meant by this?)
- octicon/emoji support (is it present?)
- ~~cmd-w doesn't close "window" when no other tabs open in current window/view. (command-shift-w does this, oops.)~~

### Features/Packages to make
- clock in status bar
- tweets/adn/mail notification in status bar
- time to read file (ala IA Writer)
- Google Music package (ala spotify/itunes package)
- html/css render preview ala md preview.
- create IF/Text Adventure/MUD in Atom.io
